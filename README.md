# Hi GitHub user! 

Welcome to my GitHub account! Sorry for the bad grammar, I can't spell. :sweat_smile: You can check out all my current engineering projects through my Robotics Team's Website [here](https://rcj.tfacademy.ca/). 

If you are looking for more information, feel free to email me [here](mailto:victorz@tfacad.ca)


In my spare time, I play chess, tennis, badminton, garden, and learn random things.
